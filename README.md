To demonstrate deadlock in C#, we can create a simple console application that creates two threads and uses two objects as locks. Here are the steps:

Create a new console application in Visual Studio.
Add the following code to the Program.cs file:



In this code, we define two objects lock1 and lock2 that will be used as locks in our methods.
We create two threads t1 and t2 that will execute our methods Method1 and Method2.
We start the threads and then wait for them to finish using Join.
In Method1, we acquire the lock on lock1 and then wait for one second using Thread.Sleep.
After waiting, we try to acquire the lock on lock2. However, if Method2 has the lock on lock2, then Method1 will wait indefinitely.
Similarly, in Method2, we acquire the lock on lock2 and then wait for one second. After waiting, we try to acquire the lock on lock1. However, if Method1 has the lock on lock1, then Method2 will wait indefinitely.
When you run this code, you will see that the program hangs and never completes. This is because Method1 and Method2 are deadlocked - each method is waiting for the other to release its lock.
This demonstrates how deadlock can occur when two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock. To avoid deadlock, you should always acquire locks in a consistent order and release locks as soon as possible.
